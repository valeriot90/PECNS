In this project we evaluate the performance in terms of response time of a system composed by a queue and L time-varying capacity servers, used one at a time and chosen by an algorithm, that serves jobs according to the FIFO policy. We test the system under various scenarios, changing quanti- tative and qualitative factors.
We use Omnet++ Simulator for the implementation of the system and Pyhton language for the data analysis.
